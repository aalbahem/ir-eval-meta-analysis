This repository contains meta-analysis tools to evaluate information retrieval evaluation metrics. 

The  [axioms folder](https://github.com/aalbahem/ir-eval-meta-analysis/tree/master/axioms) contains the code used to evaluate a wide range of metrics using a set of axioms.

Both, the intut_test and mu folders have implementations of the Intuitiveness Test and Metric Unanimity meta-analysis frameworks respectively.
They also contain the code to generate reports using latex table format.

More details will be added later.
